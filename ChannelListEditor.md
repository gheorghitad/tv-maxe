Starting with 0.05 version of TV-MAXE users can subscribe to different channel lists. Even if actually the channel lists are some text files, these must be in a specific format, making difficult to edit and maintain a channel list. This is why the Channel List Editor was made.

Using the channel editor is easy. When you started the application you get a window with some buttons and an empty list. You can choose to open an existing channel list to edit, or you can just append new channels and saving the list as a new one. When you click the Open button you can open a remote file by entering its address or you can open a local file, by choosing it using the File Chooser.

Before to add a new channel select the tab **TV Channels** if you want to add a new TV channel or **Radio Channels** to add a new radio channel. Then press the "Add" button. A window will show up with some input fields. On the **Channel name** you must write the name of the new channel. On the **Channel URL** you must to write the stream address of the new channel. Icon URL is the address to an image file which will appear with the new TV-Channel. Please note that the image size should be up to 24x24 pixels and it should be located on a HTTP server. If you're using the file browser for selecting a new image, the image will be automatically scaled to 24x24 pixels and uploaded to **imgur**. The **Channel ID** is an identificator used to get the TV Listings of the channel. The TV listing is available only for a few channels and it is taken from [kappa.ro](http://tv.kappa.ro). For example, if you want to add the listings for France 24 channel you'll have to go to the [tv.kappa.ro](http://tv.kappa.ro) and select the channel from the combobox located immediately after the "Arata programul TV pentru postul" text. Choosing France 24, for example, will redirect you to the channel's listings page, http://tv.kappa.ro/France-24. The channel ID in our case is France-24; filling it up in **Channel ID** field will make available the "TV Guide" menu in TV-MAXE application.

Note: if you want to use your newly created list locally you just need to add a link to your file to TV-Maxe's subscriptions list.
The link to your file should be like this: "[file:///home/username/Desktop/MyCustomSubscribtion](file:///home/username/Desktop/MyCustomSubscribtion)"
